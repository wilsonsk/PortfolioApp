# Design Decisions: State

### Before performing any implementation, explicitly list out the state you expect your application to need.

###### State: 
###### * LibraryList - a JSON object that contains the data replicating REST API
###### * LibrarySelector - an integer that represents the selected library 
###### * Expanded - a boolean that represents whether a given library should be expanded on UI (based on LibrarySelector)
